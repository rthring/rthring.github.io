# Introduction
My name is Ryan Thring and I am currently a 5th year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph doing a minor in Mathematics. This post will cover my 8-month work term with TRADER Corporation during the winter and summer of 2022 and I hope to explain what my goals were for the work term, what I worked on, and what I learned.

# Employer Information
During this work term I had the pleasure of returning to work for TRADER. TRADER is the leading digital marketing partner for Canadian automotive retailers and manufacturers with their marketplaces autoTRADER.ca, autoHEBDO.net, and LesPAC. They have many employees across Canada, with offices in Ontario, British Columbia, and Quebec.

# Job Description

For this 8-month term I worked directly with TRADER's architecture team. With the Architecture team I continued to work on the internal web application that was created during my previous work term and also did some minor architecture work.

The internal web application that I worked on is used to store information about all of TRADER's applications and how they interact with each other. During this time, I added more features and testing to the application, collected and stored more information from spreadsheets and surveys into our database, and demonstrated the application to other employees across the company on how it can be used. As an architect I spent some time researching different types of tools that we were looking into using at TRADER, and presented my work to others.

# Goals

During this work term I wanted to improve my proficiency with Angular. I had previously done some work with Angular but still felt like I had a lot to learn. I ended up completing an Angular course during my work term and also gained a lot more experience using in my web application development.

I was able to gain some understanding of how to use Postman for API testing. I studied some of the Postman API testing used on the AutoTrader marketplace APIs and was able to use this knowledge to create some tests for the internal web application.

I also wanted to learn how to use Selenium for automation testing purposes. I was able to learn from the Selenium testing repository used for the main AutoTrader marketplace and from members of the QA team. I was able to use this knowledge to set up tests for the internal web application that I was working on.

During my work term I was able to spend some time gaining experience with using Ataccama ONE to extract data from spreadsheets and properly store it in our databases. I updated some older workflows for importing application information from surveys, and then created entirely new workflows for some of the newer information we wanted to store.

Lastly, throughout these 8 months term I really wanted to improve my oral communication skills. During this work term I got a lot of experience in both explaining my though processes and in presenting to others in the company. I presented the internal web application, and what I had learnt in my architecture research tasks. Most of these presentations were remote but I did get to present once in-person at the office explaining a diagramming method during a workshop. Now I feel a lot more comfortable presenting in front of others thanks to the experience I gained during this term.

# Conclusion
Overall, my return to TRADER for another 8 months was an amazing experience and I am very thankful for my experiences with the company and specifically the Architecture team. I was able to learn about many different technologies and work on my oral communication skills while also having a lot of fun and meeting many amazing people.

# Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my supervisor Aleksei Chudinov for mentoring me throughout both work terms and always being able to help. I would like to thank Chief Architect Jeff Wilts for helping to involve me with other employees across the company. I would also like to thank the rest of the Architecture team for just being a great bunch of people and being very welcoming.
