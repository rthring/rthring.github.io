# Introduction
My name is Ryan Thring and I am currently a 4th year Computer Science student at the University of Guelph doing a minor in Mathematics. This post will cover my 4 month work term with TRADER Corporation during the summer of 2021 and I hope to explain my goals for the work term, what I worked on, and what I learned.

# Employer Information
For my first work term I had the pleasure of working for TRADER. TRADER is the leading digital marketing partner for Canadian automotive retailers and manufacturers with their main marketplace being autoTRADER.ca. They have offices in both Etobicoke, Ontario and Burnaby, British Columbia, along with having employees working remotely across Canada.

# Job Description
During my time with TRADER I worked as a Web App Developer. In this role I was given the opportunity to work on an internal web app for storing information about all of TRADER's applications and how they interact with each other.

Along with 2 other coop students and with the help of a Technical Architect, we built the web app completely from scratch. We had daily meetings to discuss what we were working on, what issues we were facing, and were guided on what we would have to work on next.

Throughout the work term I worked on all parts of the web app. This included the front-end which was built with Angular and the back-end which involved C# and interacting with SQL Server. I learned a lot about these technologies as I had little to no experience with all of them before the work term.

# Goals
One of my goals was become more proficient in front-end development. Previously my only experience with front-end development was in CIS 2750 but even then it was not much of a focus of the course. Throughout this work term I worked on the front-end of the internal web app and learned how to use Angular. Overall I feel a lot more confident with front-end development now and I am excited to use my skills in the future.

I also wanted to develop a solid understanding of databases during this work term as I previously had 0 experience working with databases. Our web app used SQL server to store all the information about TRADER's applications, so I got to learn a lot about databases while working on that. I believe I now have a much better understanding of databases and believe my experience will help me do well in CIS 3530 this semester.

Lastly, I wanted to get comfortable with Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code. I had never used either program previously but I wanted to get comfortable with them as they seem to be pretty standard in the computer science field. I ended up using both programs throughout the entire work term, and got a lot more comfortable with when to use them and how. I now plan on using them for my future course work and other work terms.
